A problem-solving agent for the 8-puzzle problem

In this problem we will implement a number of uninformed search techniques and test them
on the 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle problem is described in the textbook (Russell and Norvig) on page 70 and 71.
Part a. Run the plain breadth-rst search algorithm.
Part b. Breadth- rst search statistics.
Part c. Breadth- rst search with the elimination of cyclic state repeats.
Part d. Breadth- rst search with the elimination of all state repeats.
