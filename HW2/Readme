Heuristic search for the 8-puzzle problem.

In this problem we will explore heuristic search solutions for the 8-puzzle problem. We
will use the evaluation-function driven search procedure to incorporate various exploration
strategies. The procedure searches the space by expanding the nodes with the
minimum value first.
Part a. Uniform cost search
Part b. Uniform cost search with the elimination of redundant nodes
Part c. A* algorithm with the misplaced tile heuristic
Part d. Greedy search with the misplaced tile heuristic
Part e. A* with Manhattan distance heuristic
