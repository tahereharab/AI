Traveling salesman problem: Genetic algorithm

This problem investigates the same TSP problem we studied in Assignment 3.
The disadvantage of the simulated annealing algorithm is that at any point in time it keeps
only one current configuration and that next step configurations are obtained using “local”
changes. Thus, it may take a number of steps till one gets to explore good configurations.
The genetic algorithm attempts to alleviate the problems by keeping a limited number
of “current” configurations and by combining (more radically) two good quality solutions
hoping that the combination will lead to a larger improvement in the quality.
