Traveling Salesman Problem

The Traveling Salesman problem (TSP hereafter) is a classical graph-theoretical
problem. It involves a traveling salesman who has to visit each of the cities in
a given network before returning to his starting point, at which time his trip is
complete. The objective is to find the cheapest tour, that is the shortest route that
passes through each city exactly once and returns back to start.
The variants of TSP arise in the design of telephone networks and integrating circuits,
in planning construction lines, and in the programming of industrial robots,
to mention but a few applications. In all of these, the ability to find inexpensive
tours of the graphs in question can be quite crucial.
In this assignment, we explore simulated annealing solution to the TSP problem.
