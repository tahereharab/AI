Tic-tac-toe-10 player

The goal of this assignment is to implement a program capable of playing Tic-tac-toe on
the 10 × 10 board. The 3 × 3 version of the game is discussed in the textbook. Both 3 × 3
and 10 × 10 versions of the Tic-tac-toe are related to the old Japanese game of Go.
Rules. The game is played on a rectangular 10 × 10 board. There are two players, one
plays crosses, the other plays zeroes. The players alternate their moves. The first one to
achieve five of his marks in a row, a column or on a diagonal wins.
The player program you have to build will always play crosses. To test your program you
may use board positions stored in the boards subdirectory. It is always X’s turn. We
encourage you to create some interesting board positions yourself.
The program’s input is a current board position. The output is a number identifying the
board position chosen by the program. A position on a 10 × 10 board, can be represented
using two digits with values 0-9. The first digit indexes the row, the second digit the column.
For example, the output ’23’ indicates the program chose to put its mark (an ’x’) to the
second row and the third column. Note that your program chooses only its next move.
